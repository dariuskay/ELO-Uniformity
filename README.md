# ELO-Uniformity
An analysis of FiveThirtyEight's ELO metrics over baseball history

How often does a team win when [FiveThirtyEight's ELO](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-mlb-predictions/) expects them to win? How often does a team win despite ELO predicting it to lose? And how do the answers to these questions correlate with the performance of each team over the course of the past 120-or-so years?

I manipulate data from all games played since 1900. Oddly enough, all franchises to field teams in the 20th century have survived to this day. Peruse the Jupyter Notebook in the repo to assess baseball teams' performance relative to their longevity.
